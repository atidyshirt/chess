# Chess Analytics Website (WIP)

This is a web application built using node.js, mySQL database, Vue.js frontend *soon to be*
that will be able to display and store user information from chess.com and by using the
`chess-web-api` alongside my own api, will allow users to create their own accounts, link
chess.com accounts, view profiles, statistics, win loss ratios. The goal of this project is
to host an interface that allows user to see common mistakes via the chess.com stored information.

> Note: there are more effective methods for players to complete their own analysis via available chess \
> engines and databases of games. Eventually and end goal may be to implement a basic engine and database \
> to store the users games and common mistakes in order to help the player identify errors they commonly make.
